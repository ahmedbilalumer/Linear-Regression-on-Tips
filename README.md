## Tip Predictor Bot

# Overview
The Tip Predictor Bot is a simple Python application that predicts the tip amount based on the total bill using a linear regression model. This project demonstrates the use of basic machine learning techniques and serves as an educational tool to understand data preprocessing, model training, and user interaction in Python.

# Project Structure
tips.csv: The dataset containing the total bill and tip amounts, along with additional features such as gender, smoker status, day, time, and size of the party.
tip_predictor_bot.py: The main Python script that trains the linear regression model and provides an interactive bot for predicting tips.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

# Dataset
The dataset (tips.csv) contains the following columns:

total_bill: The total bill amount.
tip: The tip amount.
sex: Gender of the person paying the bill.
smoker: Whether the person is a smoker or not.
day: Day of the week.
time: Time of day (Lunch/Dinner).
size: Size of the party.

# Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib (for visualization, if needed)

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

# Usage
1. Load and Explore the Data
Before running the bot, ensure that you have explored the dataset to understand its structure and contents. The dataset should be placed in the same directory as the Python script or provide the correct path to the dataset.

2. Run the Bot
To run the bot, execute the bot.py script using a Python interpreter:

python bot.py

3. Interact with the Bot
Once the script is running, you can interact with the bot by entering the total bill amount. The bot will then predict and display the tip amount. Type exit to quit the bot.

# Example interaction:
Enter the total bill amount (or type 'exit' to quit): 20.00
The predicted tip for a total bill of 20.0 is $3.00
Enter the total bill amount (or type 'exit' to quit): 50.00
The predicted tip for a total bill of 50.0 is $7.50
Enter the total bill amount (or type 'exit' to quit): exit
Goodbye!

## Code Explanation

# Training the Model
The linear regression model is trained using the total_bill as the independent variable and tip as the dependent variable.

# Conclusion
This project provides a simple yet effective demonstration of building and deploying a machine learning model for predicting tips based on the total bill. It can be extended further by incorporating additional features or experimenting with different machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy.
